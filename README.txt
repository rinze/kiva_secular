kiva_secular
============

This little project uses Python to generate a static HTML webpage that lists
the most popular Kiva projects funded by non-religious organizations.  

The list of non-religious organizations is taken from a list created by the
Kiva Atheists group available at

You can see a demo version (updated every 5 hours) on
